    <p style="font-size: 20px; color: white;">Disney's Mulan franchise has a fictional character named Mushu, who made her debut in the animated Mulan movie in 1998. Mushu, a diminutive Chinese dragon, served as Mulan's family's protector before being demoted for neglecting to preserve an ancestor. In order to make amends, he schemes to make sure Mulan joins the army in lieu of her father and succeeds, eventually growing to be her closest confidant. In Mulan II, the follow-up, he makes an effort to ruin Mulan's upcoming marriage in order to keep Mulan under his protection.</p>
